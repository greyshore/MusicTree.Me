          At MusicTree.me, we provide an opportunity for musicians to explore
          their connections to the generations of musicians from which they are
          pedagogically descended. Discover intersecting paths and common roots
          to understand your musical heritage. Explore the landscape of
          constellation teachers and their impact on the global music community.

          Check back frequently â€“ your musical family tree is shaped by data
          shared by other users, so it will grow and change as more users share
          information.

        This is a project for our beloved musical community. We are committed to
        providing accurate information and your privacy. We will never
        sell/share your personal information.
